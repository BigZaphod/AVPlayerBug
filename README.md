# AVPlayerBug
Demonstration of an AVPlayer bug in iOS 14.5

On iOS 14.5 (and 14.5.1, and apparently on betas of 14.6) there appears to be a bug where some MP4 files (and maybe other formats as well) will stop playing audio after a minute or so. This is a minimal project to reproduces the problem.

This bug has been filed with Apple as FB9096927.
